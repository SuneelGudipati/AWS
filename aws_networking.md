## VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where users can launch resources in a virtual network. You have complete control over your network configuration, including IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and network gateways. VPC helps you securely connect your cloud resources and control how they communicate with the internet and other networks.

## Internet Gateway
An **Internet Gateway** is a resource that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It enables outbound internet access for instances with public IP addresses and inbound traffic to instances that require it. The Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available component.

## Subnets
**Subnets** are segments of a VPC's IP address range that divide the VPC into smaller, manageable chunks. Each subnet can be designated as public (accessible from the internet) or private (isolated from the internet). Subnets allow you to organize resources based on function, security, and routing requirements.

## Route Tables
**Route tables** are used to define how traffic should be directed within a VPC. They contain a set of rules, or routes, that specify how traffic should flow between subnets, to/from the internet, or to other networks. Each subnet in a VPC is associated with a route table to control its traffic routing.

## NAT Gateway
A **Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway** allows instances in a private subnet to access the internet, while preventing inbound internet traffic from reaching those instances. It's commonly used for instances that need to download updates or access external services but should remain hidden from direct internet access.

## Elastic IP (EIP)
An **Elastic IP (EIP)** is a static, public IPv4 address associated with your AWS account. Unlike regular IP addresses, EIPs allow you to easily remap the address to different resources (e.g., EC2 instances) in your VPC. This is useful when you need a persistent IP address for your services, even if instances are stopped or replaced.

## Virtual Private Network (VPN)
A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** extends your on-premises network to the AWS cloud by establishing a secure and encrypted connection. This allows you to connect your internal network to your VPC, enabling seamless communication between on-premises resources and AWS resources as if they were on the same network.

## VPC Peering
**VPC Peering** is a networking connection between two VPCs that allows them to communicate using private IP addresses. It is typically used when you have resources in different VPCs that need to interact but don't want to route traffic over the public internet. Peering connections are secure and can be established between VPCs in the same or different AWS accounts.
